# Encrypt-PE-Headers
Encrypt your PE headers to instantly invalidate your file to standard analysis tools. This makes it difficult to reverse or decrypt perfect for protection. 🔐💥


Note: This is just a sample implementation. You can create your own custom encryption/decryption routines to make reverse engineering significantly harder. I highly recommend integrating this into your manual mapping logic for maximum protection and stealth.
